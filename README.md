## Hello! 

My name is Denis Ovchinnikov.
I got my PhD in mathematics in 2020 and currently work as a professor of Mathematics at Stevens Institute of Technology, with interests in software development and data science. 

I am also a Software Developer Intern at Castle Point Learning Systems.

### Research
My research is focused on the intersection between abstract algebra (think matrices with integer elements), probability theory and complexity theory. Some of the topics that I worked on are: random structures in group theory, in particular random matrices and their properties; algorithmic problems in matrix groups. You can see list of my publications and preprints on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/math?searchtype=author&query=Ovchinnikov%2C+D).

### Programming
Since a big part of my research is focused on algorithmic complexity, I am profficient in coding efficient solutions of complex numerical problems. I have over 10 years of programming experience. Currently I do most of my programming in Python, but I used to code in C++ in the past. I also participated in three Google Kickstart rounds in 2021 finishing in top 25% of competitors each time. I uploaded my solutions to some of the rounds on [github](https://github.com/DenisOvchinnikov93/Google-kickstart-2021-e-all-problems-python).

See my [Sudoku](https://github.com/DenisOvchinnikov93/Sudoku) project for an example of a bigger project I completed. 

### Data Science
Last two years I've been also interested in data science and quatitative analysis. It really fascianates to me how much useful information can be scraped from data, and how this information can be used to improve real-life businesses and customer experience. I have done multiple projects both in classical data science (mostly supervised learning), and in quatitative analysis. I plan to share some of them once I get an ok from the relevant parties to publish the results.

### Teaching
I really enjoy teaching and helping people to discover and master new things. Over the last 10 years, I taught olimpiad math and various undergraduate and graduate courses, including several joint CS/Math courses.
